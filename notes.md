# REDUX setup

1. create a store (apply middle ware in needed , set up for chrome dev tools) in store.js
2. wrap the app with provider and pass the store (from react-redux)
### now my chrome devtools should work
3. create reducer file
5. create an initial state file
*** import this initial state file in store.js and set the initial state

4. **create types file(store all action types)

5.now to use redux store ,we need to connect the component with redux

let's do for auth
1. create two types : REGISTER SUCCESS and REGISTER FAIL
2. create a reducer file(auth.reducer.js)
 create initial state,switch,case.......

3. go to corresponding action file : auth.action.js
Here we will make the request using axios or make request to the firebase and based on the response fire a appropriate dispatch({}) 


4. now go to Auth component and connect with the redux
    import the action 
    dispatch the action wherever it needed
